New learners waste their time reading books that disrespect the greats that came before them.

Reading the source text is like playing on hard mode â€” at first it is difficult, agonizingly so, and then after a few years you become the expert.Students of philosophy read *The Beginner's Guide to Stoicism* while Marcus Aurelius' own inner thoughts [collect digital dust](http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/2680). Students of financial markets read *Hedge Fund Management 101* while Benjamin Graham's writings sit on the shelves of Buffett and Munger. 

The source texts are the roots from which new knowledge flows. Failing to invest time into these books will guardrail one's learning potential in invisible ways. The downsides are only prevalent when we try to build a new branch of knowledge and realize we have no roots.

ðŸ’¡ The first book read on a new subject should be the most foundational text available.

Approaching reading in this way allows us to stand on the shoulders of giants. Decades of other readers have combed through the modern library of Alexandria and attempted to sort the wheat from the chaff.

However, not all fields have a "source text". This is the only caveat. In this case, the best alternative is the *text that distills the fundamentals of the field*. Particularly in the sciences, this is a textbook. Reading one quality textbook can provide the base knowledge of an entire field.
