The autumn of 1727 in Philadelphia brought together five men who sought the truths of life. Among them were printers, cabinetmakers, bartenders and a clerk. The purpose of the group was *mutual improvement*. The President? Benjamin Franklin.

Each man would pose questions of moral philosophy. The intention was to refine one another's thinking and to hypothesize solutions to problems in need. Truth was sought above all. 

Each session began with an admittance that the men loved mankind and held no personal grudges. Each man was asked:

> *Do you love truth for truth's sake, and will you endeavour impartially to find and receive it yourself, and communicate it to others?"*

The answer was a chorus of agreements. 

This group was originally named the *Leather Apron Club*, and became later known as the [*Junto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junto_(club)).* The Junto set the standard for all *mutual improvement* clubs thereafter. 

### Truth Seekers

The Junto brought together those who cared about each other and the world. Juntos are everywhere — groups gathering to pose questions of life and improve one another's situations. These groups are found in dorm room basements, in locker rooms and boardrooms, on campuses, and over video calls. Life itself is a series of questions, and we are all seekers of truth. 

Truth comes in many forms. Truth stems from knowledge, skills, accomplishments, and states of being. Painters find their answers in the brush, bricklayers in the mortar, and parents in their children. The path is less important than the purpose — it did not matter that the Junto members all held different professions. What mattered was the shared willingness to question and learn. Each member aided the other in their quest for knowledge. 

The journey towards truth is a road better travelled together. It is paramount to pick the right members — the right people to journey with.

### Long-Term People

Anyone who has ventured on a road trip knows that the people make or break the trip. A car full of trusting and well-intentioned people goes smoothly. A car full of arrogant or selfish people becomes a nightmare on wheels. 

Life itself is much like a road trip — the loftiest targets have a multi-decade horizon and require us to band together to reach them. To succeed, one must become a *long-term person.*

Naval Ravikant's essay *[Play Long-term Games with Long-term People](https://nav.al/long-term)* highlights the outcomes associated with long-term people: 

> When you have been doing business with somebody, you’ve been friends with somebody for ten years, twenty years, thirty years, it just gets better and better because you trust them so easily. The friction goes down, you can do bigger, and bigger things together.
> 

Cars of long-term people can take longer trips. Professional sports teams can invest the time to learn innovative systems and recruit the right players. Investing groups can share ideas and trust others to act with integrity. Even better, the players you play with in one domain can help you thrive across others. 

### Success Across Domains

A quintessential example is Arnold Schwarzenegger and Franco Columbu. Both men were aspiring bodybuilders who still needed to put food on the table. The barrel-chested men started a bricklaying company that would fund their daily lives and provide adequate time to train. They laid bricks together during the day and lifted weights in the evenings. The two made millions together *before* the Mr Olympia titles, sponsorships, and movie deals. The prize money only grew over time. 

This same idea exists in angel networks, in alumni halls, in church groups, and so on. Shared values lead to shared pursuits, leading to trust, long-term thinking, and success. Lessons learned by one member raise the bar for all. The domains you first succeed in will provide momentum to expand into others.

Building our personal "Juntos" allows us to accomplish goals that would be insurmountable on our own. As per the proverb: 

> If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together."
