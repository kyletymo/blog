title: Can And Can't Fail

I was taking a shower in Monteverde and was thinking about inverting failure. I ended up combining two questions, one that came from a self-help book and the other from my friend Roger.  I like them for their juxtaposition and hope you find them useful too. 

Questions: 

1. What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?
2. What would you pursue even if you knew you’d fail?

My answers: 

1] **What would you do if you knew you couldn’t fail?**

Tackle the most pressing problems facing the world — since by definition, I won’t fail! The first two of which being child malnutrition and altering the economics behind preserving forests (where economics currently favour deforestation more that preservation). Child malnutrition crushes my soul and preserving global oxygen levels & temperature equilibrium lengthens the time horizon for further collective ingenuity. 

Third on the list would be providing better insights into the 10 and 30-year outcomes for present-day health inputs like sleep and diet. I would love to write “cure Alzheimer’s” on this list, and hell, I would dedicate 50 years of labour if I knew it was a foregone conclusion. But if that isn’t realistic, then I think I could drastically reduce the frequency of alzheimer’s, cancer, and similarly poor health outcomes through better forecasting and pre-emptive course correction. 

2] **What would you pursue even if you knew you’d fail?**

Very different prompt, it drives my thinking towards what is intrinsically motivating and worth the effort itself. My answer would revolve around helping children either by teaching or medical treatment. I assume failure here is more like “*Kyle is bad at it*” rather than “*Kyle injures a child*”. I’d gladly spend my life trying to be the best possible math teacher or paediatrician for young ones. I’d approach these problem sets with the best possible intentions and unwavering commitment to the craft - in which case, as long as nobody gets objectively hurt, the outcome of success or failure matters less. 

I think my thoughts in #1 around malnutrition, deforestation, etc would have merit here too. But I’ll get less intrinsic motivation from working on the problem (journey) and more from the objective improvement (destination). Whereas trying to help improve the quality of life for someone with decades yet to live feels more intrinsically rewarding. 

*A follow-up reflection...*

It’s tempting to write something like “*become a world famous rapper*” or “*write the greatest novel of all time*”. Being a famous rapper would mean I have a lot of money while pursuing an art form, while writing a great novel cements an idea of legacy, again through art. But in either case I think I’d eventually grow tired of the specific pursuit of writing catchier hooks or more prescient plot lines. I’d eventually appreciate that I had accumulated wealth so that I could tackle problems that impact other humans, like in healthcare or environmental factors or pedagogy.... which then indicates to me that I could just short-circuit the pathway to those things, particularly in the first case where success is certain.
