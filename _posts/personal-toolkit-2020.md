### **Below is a list of habits I've found to increase my enjoyment of life.**

This list is n=1. I wrote it in 2020. All the ideas listed are ones I try to practice daily. 

<aside>
üîÇ Routine

</aside>

- Wakeup around 7am on Mon-Fri. No alarms on Sat & Sun.
- Weight train or sprint each morning M-F. Get this in before 9am.
- Spend 1 hour creating in the morning. Keep distractions minimal. Aim to post publicly.
- Every Sunday, meditate for 30 minutes. *Optional: then spend a half hour reflecting.*
- Allot 16 waking hours to achieve your dreams.
- Read before bed.

‚ù§Ô∏è Health

</aside>

- Drink 1-2 coffees in the mornings. Supplement with L-theanine if jittery.
- Ketogenic diet before 11am. Avoid early blood sugar spikes. Drink more water.
- Emphasize: Vegetables, protein, healthy fats, and eating mostly in aft + eve.
- Avoid: Dairy, refined sugars, overly processed food, and eating before bed.
- Vitamin Stack: Vit B (100mg), Vit D (4,000 IU), Magnesium (250mg), Zinc (50mg).
- Use a Red Light Panel daily (10mins) and a [Vielight](http://vielight.com) 3-4x per week

<aside>
üß† Mental

</aside>

- Aim to meditate for 10-20 minutes each day. You'll miss some days; that is fine.
- Core frames of life: (1) Abundance mentality (2) Create value for others (3) Live your personal hero‚Äôs journey
- Avoid overthinking like the plague. Break cyclical thought patterns early on.
- When in doubt, return to your *Why.* You can't lose when you make the world a better place.
- Place Virtue as the cardinal value. Integrity above everything else. There are no do-overs.

<aside>
üí™ Physical

</aside>

- Prioritize anaerobic systems. Swing kettlebells, run sprints, do sets of chin-ups.
- Use 10 minutes throughout the day to explore range-of-motion for each joint.
- Train at 80% effort, 80% of the time.  Skip the odd day, go ballistic on others.
- Splice movement throughout the day. 10 more pullups/day = 3,600 in a year.
- Return to nature whenever possible. Earth more. Get direct sunlight. Hug trees. Swim in lakes. Stare at the stars.

<aside>
üëê Interpersonal

</aside>

- Schedule weekly check-in calls with Dad. And then call intermittently throughout the week.
- Make time to text with Chase throughout the day. Call Mom at random times too.
- Respond incredibly quickly to core 20 friends. Don't sweat the rest.
- Aim to be a True Friend to a small tribe. Bias towards fewer people, deeper friendships.

<aside>
‚ÜóÔ∏è Future

</aside>

- Optimize for 3 parameters: value created, regret minimization, personal satisfaction.
- If people don't think you're a *little bit crazy*, you're not taking enough risk.
- Endeavor to make each year of your life unique.
- Avoid long-term plans - they‚Äôre wrong anyway. Set initial course, pivot as needed.
- Frame the future with excitement (more life to live!) + a hint of fear (cherish today!)
