My current thesis is that older friends are a cheat code to a better life. I prefer to have older friends: in most cases older people have seen, lived, tried, and learned more. Their stories are abundant and learned wisdom is accessible. Particularly at 24, the difference between 24 and 28, or 24 and 32, is staggering. 

And as I round the corner on 24, I see that many of my (older) friends have entered into relationships that they take seriously. Some friends are already married. They are in relationships with people who reinforce their values, who challenge them to grow, who support them in unique ways, and direct their trend of personal development upward. 

To me, this is the hallmark of a good relationship: *whether this person's presence in your life enable you to become a better version of yourself.* A relationship where this is true for both parties results in the relationship cultivating better people than the two individuals that entered it. This mutually-beneficial dynamic spurs growth in ways that are inaccessible by ourselves.

As someone who was raised by divorced parents, stable marriages like this often felt like a pipe dream. Since having dated others who come from families of healthy parental dynamics, a stable marriage appears to be not only a cheat code, but a grounding point for other relationships. 

The canonical examples are holidays. Holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas involve multiple people getting together and being in each other's company for hours at a time. It's no coincidence that these gatherings often revolve around a stable marriage. A healthy marriage tends to include a spacious home (extra bedrooms), a diversity of opinion (two parents vs one), genuine care for others (the marriage is working), and an environment conducive to raising children â€” a welcoming environment for any social gathering. 

Hosting a dinner in the home of a single person is different: there will be fewer dishes, less space, less diversity in the discussion, and only one person to shower the guests in a feeling of welcomeness. The trajectory of most smart/rich people is towards marriage, which means that there are likely to be more couples than there are singles. 

This is even more apparent in friend groups. Many of my older friends mentioned earlier have tied the knot or plan to. Gone are the days of bar-hopping in search of a new partner, welcomed are the days of early dinners out and a visit to the quaint countryside. Vacation planning now inevitably sparks the question of "can my partner come?" and dinner reservations can double through the addition of +1's. 

Strengthening a friendship is much like finding a puzzle piece whose corners and gaps  connects well with your own. It only takes a single piece to match with another. The move from single to married marks a shift from having a single piece to connect with, to two. And two-piece puzzles are best solved with pairs of pieces. 

This then raises the question of how to find your own life partner that aligns with the definition listed above. I am unqualified to provide advice here, but there is a high probability that my future partner and I would be happy to host you in the future.
