Existentialist philsophers are a rollercoaster to read. Portraits of man range from Sisyphus to the Ubermensch, perspectives from gloom to hope. Truly asking the question of why we are here, and what this is all about, is a one-way door. The question seeps into the marrow of the soul. 

I’ve seen an existentialist phase happen in most of my smart friends. I’ve heard about it anecdotally from people I admire. There are often months to years grappling with the question to seemingly no avail. The lack of answers is when the darkness feels heaviest. 

The question of why we are here does not need to have a generalized answer in order for it to be personally resolved. I would posit that the answer we reason into ourselves holds the greatest value. It is most likely to provide the direction we seek. 

For myself, I have found the answer through a dedication to domains of life that I enjoy the foundations of, that I can strive for mastery within, and in which I can positively impact the world at large. The litmus test has become: do I enjoy it, can I learn to improve, and is it useful for myself or others? Answering yes these questions indications that I am directionally correct. 

The arc of my life (and maybe yours) then involves answering yes to these questions over a multi-decade time horizon. For more personal context, the recent years have illuminated my genuine love for learning and how my empathy drives me towards wanting to build solutions for human-impacting problems. Learning how to build solutions for those problems offers deep satisfaction. This simplifies to areas of life that are difficult to learn and hold causal impact on human quality of life. Overcoming the difficulty to create impact is what leads to satisfaction. 

Which areas of life contain these factors? There are three primary areas: companies, craftsmanship, and children. Companies allow us to gather resources and apply leverage towards a meaningful problem. Craftsmanship opens the door to mastery through learning, and the deeply rooted satisfaction born from improvement and accomplishing things you previously felt impossible. Children are the opportunity we have to create a flourishing human life from its foundations, and challenge us to live with virtue as a model for our children. 

I’d like to spend my lifetime seeking mastery in the crafts of being a father to my children, to building impactful companies, and a handful of smaller domains like writing and teaching. Pursuing excellence in these areas means I will encounter problems of all forms and have to stretch myself into the person who can solve them. Learning, and satisfaction, will be abundant.
