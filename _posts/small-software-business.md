title: Build The Smallest Possible Software Business

**There are an infinite number of opportunities for small, software-enabled businesses**.

I've come to accept that there are degrees of scale I cannot fathom. And that there is more money in the world than I could ever imagine. 

Googling "Fed Cash Injection" ends up returning a list of numbers impossible to visualize. $454 Billion. $2.3 Trillion. Hell, there are more zeroes than there are letters in my last name. 

Our minds struggle to visualize the scale of these numbers. At some point, we resign to accepting that the scale of the economy exceeds our grasp. Imagining the largest number possible still leaves you at a number that is too small. 

This idea feels reminiscent of "Patio11's Law":

Imagining all of the possible applications of software *still* doesn't get us to an accurate understanding of scale. At a point it's safer to assume that software does apply rather than it doesn't. Andreessen was right, software is eating the world.

**Intuition for Scale**

A world being eaten by software feels one where you should build the largest software business. Find a blue ocean and soak up as much of it as you can. This is the opposite intuition needed to succeed on your own. 

Higher odds of success await those who solve the smallest possible problems. Even better, solve a known problem in an incrementally better way. Nick Huber wrote an incredible thread on this idea:

The main takeaway: 

> "I know a lot of wealth entrepreneurs. None of them had new ideas. None of them raised VC money. None of them were on shark tank. They all did common things uncommonly well. Regular old businesses just a little better"

A world of limitless scale requires targeted thinking. Truly, as small as is first possible. The undertow of endless blue oceans drowns out many of the ideas looking to span the globe. 

Just because we exist in a limitless world does not mean limitless ideas have the highest chance of succeeding. 

**Reframe: Start Small**

Whereas Henry Ford envisioned a factory pumping out Model T's by the minute, today's visionaries can take scale for granted. There is an [army of robots freely available to anyone](https://nav.al/rich).

Software has solved the scale problem. Labour is not the competitive advantage it once was. The bottleneck is relevance. 

Small service businesses offer the answer to the relevance question: they knock on doors. They focus on a single person at a time and see if the needs match the offer. They make cold calls and do one job at a time. 

This idea applies to software-enabled businesses too. As Substack wrote in their [call-to-arms](https://blog.substack.com/p/you-should-start-your-own-media-business):

> The beauty of the Substack model is that it’s simple. You publish a newsletter and ask people to pay for subscriptions. That’s it. All going well, over time you’ll attract more and more subscribers, which means you’ll get more and more money. 

With subscriptions, you don’t need a giant audience. You just need some people who love your work enough to pay. A thousand people paying $100 a year is $100,000.

This is the exact playbook Kevin Kelly laid out in [1,000 True Fans](https://kk.org/thetechnium/1000-true-fans/). And it works. Whether you subscribe to Huber's camp of empowering a sweaty business or you'd prefer to keep your white collar clean, our infinitely scaled world requires intimately small solutions. After all, every business is built one customer at a time.
