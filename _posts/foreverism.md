**Each day we choose whether to live as if we will die tomorrow or that we will live forever.**

One path guides us to think short-term and pursue things that don't make us happy in the long-run. The other path guides to think long-term and pursue things that make us happy in the short-run.

These ideas are polarizing and mutually-exclusive. There is little room for a middle ground.

It is a choice of whether to live as if your days are limited or unlimited. Those who fear death are scared by the idea of an uncertain tomorrow. Those who fear life scoff at the idea of an infinite horizon.

The question frames whether we spend our lives focused on things that enrich us and make our days better, or whether we spend our lives in fear of not making time for our dreams.

Regardless of which side of the discussion you fall on, the truth is there are no moments left to waste.

Each day we choose whether to focus on today or tomorrow.

Both perspectives are paradigm-shifting. The difference is found in whether we live as if tomorrow is either non-existent or nearly guaranteed. These beliefs inform our worldview, which go on to impact all of the other contents within our worlds.

One's orientation towards the future largely influences their propensity to take risks, to carry existential fear, and to make short-term sacrifices.

So many of us live in the unsatisfying middle ground: death is a conclusion held far enough away that it does not influence our daily actions, but held close enough that we find a way to arrive at it's doorstep without doing what we wish we had done.

It's neither today nor tomorrow — we do not live as if today is our last, and we do not live as if we would live if tomorrow was guaranteed.

The first step to take is to abandon the middle ground. The middle ground incurs no sense of urgency and also fails to drive us towards what is meaningful to us.

Now we can explore the first extreme: Today, or the idea of the "daily death".

The daily death is the idea of living as if each day of ours will be our last.

It is the idea that future days are guaranteed to nobody and that each day should bring us closure. The strongest example of this idea is found in the Japanese Samurai culture.

In the seminal text *[Hagakure](http://3yryua3n3eu3i4gih2iopzph.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/pdf/hagakure.pdf),* master samurai Yamamoto Tsunetomo cogently writes:

The Way of the Samurai is found in death.

As well as how to practice this thinking:

"Meditation on inevitable death should be performed daily. Every day when one's body and mind are at peace, one should meditate upon being ripped apart by arrows, rifles spears and swords ... And every day without fail one should consider himself as dead."

From this perspective, death is to be remembered and accepted as a foregone conclusion.

The idea of *Memento Mori* (remember death) is similar — death is a looming force to be kept close to the heart as a reminder and an inspiration for a meaningful today.

Samurai culture is one of unwavering commitment to the Bushido (Samurai) code. Life derives its meaning from upholding the code and living true to its principles. Each day lived in accordance to this code is self-validating and can serve as the concluding chapter in one's life story.

This takes the Tumblr-ized idea of "live each day as if it were your last" to the extreme. Whereas some consider this idea and implement it halfway, the Samurai would live this principle out fully. The practice of Seppuku (suicide in order to uphold the code) illuminates the intensity of their belief.

On the opposite end of the spectrum lies the idea of living forever.

This philosophy does not necessarily believe that tomorrow is guaranteed. Instead, it implies that the ways in which we live today are improved if we also live as we would like to tomorrow. Rather than consider each day as the bookend to our life's story (the daily death) we live our daily lives so that we would be content if we were to live the same way for all future days to come.

While life is guaranteed to nobody, it is a reasonable expectation to believe we will live to see tomorrow. This means that we should be prepared for it, and act so that tomorrow will bring us the same joys as today. This idea is well-described in a [2016 commencement speech](https://www.notion.so/Forever-ism-101-c05bf32436e647dfac4374c9632703e3?pvs=21) by entrepreneur Peter Thiel:

"The other cliché goes like this: 'Live each day as if it were your last.' The best way to take this as advice is to do exactly the opposite. Live each day as if you will live forever."

Thiel calls out the thousands of Tumblr pages who have repurposed Tsunetomo's philosophy into cursive writing over a star-lit background. The idea of living-each-day-as-if-it's-your-last is good self-help fodder but is rarely embodied as the Samurai once did. No owner of a cliché instagram account would consider committing Seppuku.

This short-terminism can drive poor decision-making, particularly when there is no code to uphold that transcends the individual.

Instead, Thiel is advocating for playing life as a infinite game. Living forever incentivizes us to play long-term games with long-term people and to focus on what is meaningful *now* and to maintain that focus tomorrow. Thiel continues on to describe how this thinking applies to our relationships

That means, first and foremost, that you should treat the people around you as if they too will be around for a very long time to come. The choices that you make today matter, because their consequences will grow greater and greater. That is what Einstein was getting at when he supposedly said that compound interest is the most powerful force in the universe. This isn’t just about finance or money, but it’s about the idea that you’ll get the best returns in life from investing your time in building durable friendships and long-lasting relationships.

Today's choices profoundly influence the opportunities held by the rest of our lives. This idea goes beyond relationships. By choosing to live with an infinite time horizon, we cut through the tradeoffs inherent in overemphasizing tomorrow. We can focus on a year, decade, or even century from now.

The idea of living forever turns our lifetime into an infinite game. One where we live and build towards a better future *and* where we live out that better future in the here-and-now.

This belief is called "foreverism" (or at least, we should coin it as such).

**Foreverism is the idea of *living today as if you will live forever*.**

This principles is implicit in most of the change-makers who have lived throughout history. Einstein spent his entire life inventing, Martin Luther King Jr lived a life of advocacy for civil rights, Marcus Aurelius forever lived as a humble-yet-noble King, and the list goes on. Orienting towards forever brings us greater wisdom and purpose in the lives we live today.

The trouble is that we live in (and often live as) people more focused on satisfying our egos and approaching life with impatience. Societally, we reward short-term pay-offs greater than we do long-term growth. It is easier to focus on the quick-win than succeeding over the long-haul. This orientation fails us both professionally and personally.

Life should be approached with an orientation towards forever. We live better lives with an orientation towards a never-ending future rather than towards a fated tomorrow. We carry less stress and make long-term decisions. We prioritize the people we love the most and take the time to nurture our relationships with them. We focus on what matters and end each day feeling satisfied. We identify what is true to ourselves, and then we live out that truth in each and every day. Live today as if you will live forever.
