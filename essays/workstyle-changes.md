title: Workstyle Changes in 2022

There are two workstyle changes that I am going to make in 2022:

1. Build repeatable processes wherever possible. 
2. Create a resource-abundant environment to make decisions and do the work only I can do. 

Upon reflection, I noticed that each suboptimal decision I made last year occurred when my personal life held high levels of conflict or indecision. The times where I spent my leisure hours deliberating over alternatives and reconsidering my values consumed precious thinking hours and reduced my emotional availability. This then preoccupied my mind at work and decreased my ability to deliberate over alternatives and make sound decisions. 

In my personal life, 2021 was a year of emotionally-draining decisions that required a *ton* of contemplation in order to arrive at the right outcomes. The perfect example is deciding to pursue a Masters degree in the UK on scholarship, only to withrdaw a month prior and move into my preferred function at work. The original decision to go overseas was draining, the decision to stay was even moreso, and then I moved to a new city, ended a 9-month relationship, and ramped into a new role (+ started to build a new team). A similar trend repeated in December 2021, with the new addition of conflict in some personal relationships. 

So the true need is to be more emotionally available in daily life. When I am present and unburdened, I excel in my work. However, this is a product of being authentic and true to myself in my own life (both work + personal) and not having trajectory changing decisions looming overhead.

The input variable that I can focus on is processizing everything that is routine. To use my colleagues Samuel’s phrasing, the goal is to “automate yourself out of the job”. This will never be fully possible but provides a directional intent to standardize the repeated. 

The primary benefit of increased process is that you then create additional space for the work that only you can do. For myself, these buckets are connection, synthesis, and strategy.

I have met few people who are able to build trusting relationships as quickly and as broadly as myself. In tandem, I’ve been at Convicitonal and worked with Roger + Chris for so long that the product strategy has become second-nature to me. And while likely not in the 1% globally, I tend to synthesize information rapidly as I learn quickly and have a high tolerance for ambiguity. 

Recruting is the perfect example of a responsibility that benefits from both changes. Recruiting is both worthwhile and highly repetitious. The process of posting new roles, building a candidate pipeline, soliciting the candidates, and driving towards an offer does not require active thinking work. However, the ability to sell Convictional as a place to work requires considered thought and tailoring to each person I speak with. The ideal recruiting process becomes a streamlined system of tasks coupled with 1:1 conversations where I am fully present and emotionally available. 

If I were to summarize this idea in two books, it would be “[The Checklist Manifesto](https://www.amazon.com/Checklist-Manifesto-How-Things-Right/dp/0312430000)” meets “[Wherever You Go, There You Are](https://www.amazon.com/Wherever-You-There-Are-Mindfulness/dp/1401307787)”. 

Automate the repetitive to create space for the specialized work. Processize the routine, and be fully present for the few things that matter the most.
